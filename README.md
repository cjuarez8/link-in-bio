# html template

In this repository, I made a fully responsive website using HTML and CSS. To do this, I made an index.html file that where you can find the majority of the code. 
I first started with creating the body of the website and all the components of it, including my photo, name, and links of stuff that I like.
Afterwards, I create hyperlinks that take the user to various websites, including my LinkedIn and Github.
I then focused on making the website look more visually appealing by adding a nice background and images with the hyperlinks.
